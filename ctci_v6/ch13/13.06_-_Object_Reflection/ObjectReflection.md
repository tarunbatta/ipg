Explain what object reflection is in Java and why it is useful.

Object Reflection is a feature in Java that allows you to get information about objects and classes at runtime. It is very useful for debugging. You can get information about the methods and fields present inside of a class/object, create new objects, and get/set object fields directly, regardless of what the access modifier is.
