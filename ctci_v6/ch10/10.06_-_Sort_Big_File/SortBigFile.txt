Imagine you have a 20 GB file with one string per line. Explain how you would sort the file.

Given the memory space requirement for traditional sorting algorithms, we should figure out a way of sorting without using much space.
What we can do is only load a chunk of the file in at a time. We can load a small chunk, sort it, then save it, and repeat for all chunks.
Once we sort all chunks, we use merge sort to merge and sort the chunks one by one.
This is refered to as an external sort.
