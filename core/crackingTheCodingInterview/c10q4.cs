/*
Sorted Search, No Size: You are given an array-like data structure Listy which lacks a size
method.It does, however, have an elementAt(i) method that returns the element at index i in
0(1) time.If i is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1. (For this reason, the data
structure only supports positive integers.) Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers,
find the index at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times, you may return any index.
