/*
Pattern Matching: You are given two strings, pattern and value. The pattern string consists of
just the letters a and b, describing a pattern within a string. For example, the string catcatgocatgo
matches the pattern aabab(where cat is a and go is b). It also matches patterns like a, ab, and b.
Write a method to determine if value matches pattern.
