/*
Rank from Stream: Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to be able
to look up the rank of a number x(the number of values less than or equal to x). Implement the data
structures and algorithms to support these operations.That is, implement the method track (int x),
which is called when each number is generated, and the method getRankOfNumber(int x),
which returns the number of values less than or equal to X(not including x itself).
EXAMPLE
Stream(inorderofappearance): 5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 9, 7, 13, 3
getRankOfNumber(l) = 0
getRankOfNumber(3) = 1
getRankOfNumber(4) = 3
