/*
XML Encoding: Since XML is very verbose, you are given a way of encoding it where each tag gets
mapped to a pre-defined integer value.The language/grammar is as follows:
Element     --> Tag Attributes END Children END
Attribute   --> Tag Value
END         --> 0
Tag         --> some predefined mapping to int
Value       --> string value
For example, the following XML might be converted into the compressed string below(assuming a
mapping of family -> 1, person -> 2, firstName -> 3, lastName -> 4, state -> 5).
<family lastName = 'McDowell' state='CA'>
<person firstName = 'Gayle' > Some Message</person>
</family>
Becomes:
1 4 McDowell 5 CA 0 2 3 Gayle e Some Message 0 0
Write code to print the encoded version of an XML element(passed in Element and Attribute
objects).
