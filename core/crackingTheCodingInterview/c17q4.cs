/*
Missing Number: An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which
is missing.In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation.The
elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is "fetch
the jth bit of A[i] ," which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do
it in O(n) time?
