/*
Word Rectangle: Given a list of millions of words, design an algorithm to create the largest possible
rectangle of letters such that every row forms a word (reading left to right) and every column forms
a word(reading top to bottom). The words need not be chosen consecutively from the list, but all
rows must be the same length and all columns must be the same height.
