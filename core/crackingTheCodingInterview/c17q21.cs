/*
Volume of Histogram: Imagine a histogram (bar graph). Design an algorithm to compute the
volume of water it could hold if someone poured water across the top. You can assume that each
histogram bar has width 1.
EXAMPLE (Black bars are the histogram.Gray is water.)
Input:  { 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 }
Output: 26
