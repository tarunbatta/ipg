/*
FizzBuzz: In the classic problem FizzBuzz, you are told to print the numbers from 1 to n. However,
when the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz': When it is divisible by 5, print "Buzz': When it is divisible
by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz': In this problem, you are asked to do this in a multithreaded way.
Implement a multithreaded version of FizzBuzz with four threads.One thread checks for divisibility
of 3 and prints "Fizz': Another thread is responsible for divisibility of 5 and prints "Buzz': A third thread
is responsible for divisibility of 3 and 5 and prints "FizzBuzz". A fourth thread does the numbers.
