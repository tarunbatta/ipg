/*
Check Subtree: Tl and T2 are two very large binary trees, with Tl much bigger than T2. Create an
algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of Tl.
A tree T2 is a subtree ofTi if there exists a node n in Ti such that the subtree of n is identical to T2.
That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.
