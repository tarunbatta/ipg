/*
192. Word Frequency
Medium

Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:


	words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space &apos; &apos; characters.
	Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
	Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.


Example:

Assume that words.txt has the following content:

the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is


Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:

the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1


Note:


	Don&apos;t worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word&apos;s frequency count is unique.
	Could you write it in one-line using Unix pipes?
