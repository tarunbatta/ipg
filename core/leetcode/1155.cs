1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum
Medium

You have d dice, and each die has f faces numbered 1, 2, ..., f.

Return the number of possible ways (out of fd&#xA0;total ways) modulo 10^9 + 7 to roll the dice so the sum of the face up numbers equals target.

&#xA0;
Example 1:

Input: d = 1, f = 6, target = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 
You throw one die with 6 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of 3.


Example 2:

Input: d = 2, f = 6, target = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: 
You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.  There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7:
1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.


Example 3:

Input: d = 2, f = 5, target = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: 
You throw two dice, each with 5 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of 10: 5+5.


Example 4:

Input: d = 1, f = 2, target = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 
You throw one die with 2 faces.  There is no way to get a sum of 3.


Example 5:

Input: d = 30, f = 30, target = 500
Output: 222616187
Explanation: 
The answer must be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.


&#xA0;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= d, f &lt;= 30
	1 &lt;= target &lt;= 1000
