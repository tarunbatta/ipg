696. Count Binary Substrings
Easy

Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0&apos;s and 1&apos;s, and all the 0&apos;s and all the 1&apos;s in these substrings are grouped consecutively. 

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

Example 1:
Input: &quot;00110011&quot;
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1&apos;s and 0&apos;s: &quot;0011&quot;, &quot;01&quot;, &quot;1100&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;0011&quot;, and &quot;01&quot;.
Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
Also, &quot;00110011&quot; is not a valid substring because all the 0&apos;s (and 1&apos;s) are not grouped together.



Example 2:
Input: &quot;10101&quot;
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: &quot;10&quot;, &quot;01&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;01&quot; that have equal number of consecutive 1&apos;s and 0&apos;s.



Note:
s.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
s will only consist of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; characters.
