875. Koko Eating Bananas
Medium

Koko loves to eat bananas.&#xA0; There are N&#xA0;piles of bananas, the i-th&#xA0;pile has piles[i] bananas.&#xA0; The guards have gone and will come back in H hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of K.&#xA0; Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas, and eats K bananas from that pile.&#xA0; If the pile has less than K bananas, she eats all of them instead, and won&apos;t eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back.

Return the minimum integer K such that she can eat all the bananas within H hours.

Example 1:

Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], H = 8
Output: 4



Example 2:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 5
Output: 30



Example 3:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 6
Output: 23


&#xA0;

Note:


	1 &lt;= piles.length &lt;= 10^4
	piles.length &lt;= H &lt;= 10^9
	1 &lt;= piles[i] &lt;= 10^9
