/*
438. Find All Anagrams in a String
Medium

Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p&apos;s anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:
Input:
s: &quot;cbaebabacd&quot; p: &quot;abc&quot;

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is &quot;cba&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;abc&quot;.
The substring with start index = 6 is &quot;bac&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;abc&quot;.



Example 2:
Input:
s: &quot;abab&quot; p: &quot;ab&quot;

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is &quot;ab&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;ab&quot;.
The substring with start index = 1 is &quot;ba&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;ab&quot;.
The substring with start index = 2 is &quot;ab&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;ab&quot;.
