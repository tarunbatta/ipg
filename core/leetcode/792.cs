792. Number of Matching Subsequences
Medium

Given string S and a&#xA0;dictionary of words words, find the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of S.

Example :
Input: 
S = &quot;abcde&quot;
words = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;, &quot;acd&quot;, &quot;ace&quot;]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;acd&quot;, &quot;ace&quot;.


Note:


	All words in words and S will only consists of lowercase letters.
	The length of S will be in the range of [1, 50000].
	The length of words will be in the range of&#xA0;[1, 5000].
	The length of words[i] will be in the range of [1, 50].
