866. Prime Palindrome
Medium

Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to N.

Recall that a&#xA0;number is prime if it&apos;s only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1.&#xA0;

For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are&#xA0;primes.

Recall that a number is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.&#xA0;

For example, 12321 is a palindrome.

&#xA0;


Example 1:

Input: 6
Output: 7



Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 11



Example 3:

Input: 13
Output: 101




&#xA0;

Note:


	1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^8
	The answer is guaranteed to exist and be less than 2 * 10^8.
