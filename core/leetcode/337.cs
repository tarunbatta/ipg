337. House Robber III
Medium

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the &quot;root.&quot; Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that &quot;all houses in this place forms a binary tree&quot;. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Output: 7 
Explanation:&#xA0;Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

Example 2:

Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

&#xA0;    3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Output: 9
Explanation:&#xA0;Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
