/*
1092. Shortest Common Supersequence 
Hard

Given two strings str1 and str2,&#xA0;return the shortest string that has both str1&#xA0;and str2&#xA0;as subsequences.&#xA0;&#xA0;If multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.

(A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of characters from T (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen anywhere from T) results in the string S.)

&#xA0;

Example 1:

Input: str1 = &quot;abac&quot;, str2 = &quot;cab&quot;
Output: &quot;cabac&quot;
Explanation: 
str1 = &quot;abac&quot; is a subsequence of &quot;cabac&quot; because we can delete the first &quot;c&quot;.
str2 = &quot;cab&quot; is a subsequence of &quot;cabac&quot; because we can delete the last &quot;ac&quot;.
The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.


&#xA0;

Note:


	1 &lt;= str1.length, str2.length &lt;= 1000
	str1 and str2 consist of lowercase English letters.
