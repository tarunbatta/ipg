332. Reconstruct Itinerary
Medium

Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

Note:


	If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary [&quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;LGA&quot;] has a smaller lexical order than [&quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;LGB&quot;].
	All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
	You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.


Example 1:

Input: [[&quot;MUC&quot;, &quot;LHR&quot;], [&quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;MUC&quot;], [&quot;SFO&quot;, &quot;SJC&quot;], [&quot;LHR&quot;, &quot;SFO&quot;]]
Output: [&quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;MUC&quot;, &quot;LHR&quot;, &quot;SFO&quot;, &quot;SJC&quot;]


Example 2:

Input: [[&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;],[&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;],[&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;],[&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;JFK&quot;],[&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;]]
Output: [&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is [&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;].
&#xA0;            But it is larger in lexical order.
