/*
76. Minimum Window Substring
Hard

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

Example:

Input: S = &quot;ADOBECODEBANC&quot;, T = &quot;ABC&quot;
Output: &quot;BANC&quot;


Note:


	If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string &quot;&quot;.
	If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
