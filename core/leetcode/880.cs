880. Decoded String at Index
Medium

An encoded string S is given.&#xA0; To find and write the decoded string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time&#xA0;and the following steps are taken:


	If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
	If the character read is a digit (say d), the entire current tape is repeatedly written&#xA0;d-1&#xA0;more times in total.


Now for some encoded string S, and an index K, find and return the K-th letter (1 indexed) in the decoded string.

&#xA0;


Example 1:

Input: S = &quot;leet2code3&quot;, K = 10
Output: &quot;o&quot;
Explanation: 
The decoded string is &quot;leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode&quot;.
The 10th letter in the string is &quot;o&quot;.



Example 2:

Input: S = &quot;ha22&quot;, K = 5
Output: &quot;h&quot;
Explanation: 
The decoded string is &quot;hahahaha&quot;.  The 5th letter is &quot;h&quot;.



Example 3:

Input: S = &quot;a2345678999999999999999&quot;, K = 1
Output: &quot;a&quot;
Explanation: 
The decoded string is &quot;a&quot; repeated 8301530446056247680 times.  The 1st letter is &quot;a&quot;.


&#xA0;

Note:


	2 &lt;= S.length &lt;= 100
	S&#xA0;will only contain lowercase letters and digits 2 through 9.
	S&#xA0;starts with a letter.
	1 &lt;= K &lt;= 10^9
	The decoded string is guaranteed to have less than 2^63 letters.
