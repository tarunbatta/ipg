665. Non-decreasing Array
Easy

Given an array with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.



We define an array is non-decreasing if array[i] &lt;= array[i + 1] holds for every i (1 &lt;= i &lt; n).


Example 1:
Input: [4,2,3]
Output: True
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.



Example 2:
Input: [4,2,1]
Output: False
Explanation: You can&apos;t get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.



Note:
The n belongs to [1, 10,000].
