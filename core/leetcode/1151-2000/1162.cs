1162. As Far from Land as Possible
Medium

Given an N x N grid&#xA0;containing only values 0 and 1, where&#xA0;0 represents water&#xA0;and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized and return the distance.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance:&#xA0;the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

&#xA0;

Example 1:



Input: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.


Example 2:



Input: [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.


&#xA0;

Note:


	1 &lt;= grid.length == grid[0].length&#xA0;&lt;= 100
	grid[i][j]&#xA0;is 0 or 1
