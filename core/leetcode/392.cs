/*
392. Is Subsequence
Easy

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.



You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (&lt;=100).



A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, &quot;ace&quot; is a subsequence of &quot;abcde&quot; while &quot;aec&quot; is not).


Example 1:
s = &quot;abc&quot;, t = &quot;ahbgdc&quot;


Return true.


Example 2:
s = &quot;axc&quot;, t = &quot;ahbgdc&quot;


Return false.


Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k &gt;= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
