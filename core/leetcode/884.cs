884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences
Easy

We are given two sentences A and B.&#xA0; (A sentence&#xA0;is a string of space separated words.&#xA0; Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is uncommon&#xA0;if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words.&#xA0;

You may return the list in any order.

&#xA0;





Example 1:

Input: A = &quot;this apple is sweet&quot;, B = &quot;this apple is sour&quot;
Output: [&quot;sweet&quot;,&quot;sour&quot;]



Example 2:

Input: A = &quot;apple apple&quot;, B = &quot;banana&quot;
Output: [&quot;banana&quot;]


&#xA0;

Note:


	0 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 200
	0 &lt;= B.length &lt;= 200
	A and B both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
