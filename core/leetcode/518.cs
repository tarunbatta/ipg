518. Coin Change 2
Medium

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.




&#xA0;

Example 1:

Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1


Example 2:

Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.


Example 3:

Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1


&#xA0;

Note:

You can assume that


	0 &lt;= amount &lt;= 5000
	1 &lt;= coin &lt;= 5000
	the number of coins is less than 500
	the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer
