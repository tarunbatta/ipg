/*
686. Repeated String Match
Easy

Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = &quot;abcd&quot; and B = &quot;cdabcdab&quot;.

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (&#x201C;abcdabcdabcd&#x201D;), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times (&quot;abcdabcd&quot;).

Note:
The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
