564. Find the Closest Palindrome
Hard

Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. 

The &apos;closest&apos; is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.

Example 1:
Input: &quot;123&quot;
Output: &quot;121&quot;



Note:

The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
