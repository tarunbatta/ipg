1001. Grid Illumination
Hard

On a N x N grid of cells, each cell (x, y) with 0 &lt;= x &lt; N and 0 &lt;= y &lt; N has a lamp.

Initially, some number of lamps are on.&#xA0; lamps[i] tells us the location of the i-th lamp that is on.&#xA0; Each lamp that is on illuminates every square on its x-axis, y-axis, and both diagonals (similar to a Queen in chess).

For the i-th query&#xA0;queries[i] = (x, y), the answer to the query is 1 if the cell (x, y) is illuminated, else 0.

After each query (x, y) [in the order given by queries], we turn off any&#xA0;lamps that are at cell (x, y)&#xA0;or are adjacent 8-directionally (ie., share a corner or edge with cell (x, y).)

Return an array of answers.&#xA0; Each&#xA0;value answer[i] should be equal to the answer of the i-th query queries[i].

&#xA0;

Example 1:

Input: N = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: 
Before performing the first query we have both lamps [0,0] and [4,4] on.
The grid representing which cells are lit looks like this, where [0,0] is the top left corner, and [4,4] is the bottom right corner:
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Then the query at [1, 1] returns 1 because the cell is lit.  After this query, the lamp at [0, 0] turns off, and the grid now looks like this:
1 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Before performing the second query we have only the lamp [4,4] on.  Now the query at [1,0] returns 0, because the cell is no longer lit.


&#xA0;

Note:


	1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^9
	0 &lt;= lamps.length &lt;= 20000
	0 &lt;= queries.length &lt;= 20000
	lamps[i].length == queries[i].length == 2
