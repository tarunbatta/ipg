205. Isomorphic Strings
Easy

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = &quot;egg&quot;, t = &quot;add&quot;
Output: true


Example 2:

Input: s = &quot;foo&quot;, t = &quot;bar&quot;
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: s = &quot;paper&quot;, t = &quot;title&quot;
Output: true

Note:
You may assume both s&#xA0;and t&#xA0;have the same length.
