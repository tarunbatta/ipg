89. Gray Code
Medium

The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

Example 1:

Input:&#xA0;2
Output:&#xA0;[0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

For a given&#xA0;n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

00 - 0
10 - 2
11 - 3
01 - 1


Example 2:

Input:&#xA0;0
Output:&#xA0;[0]
Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
&#xA0;            A gray code sequence of n has size = 2n, which for n = 0 the size is 20 = 1.
&#xA0;            Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].
