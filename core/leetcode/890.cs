890. Find and Replace Pattern
Medium

You have a list of&#xA0;words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)

Return a list of the words in words&#xA0;that match the given pattern.&#xA0;

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: words = [&quot;abc&quot;,&quot;deq&quot;,&quot;mee&quot;,&quot;aqq&quot;,&quot;dkd&quot;,&quot;ccc&quot;], pattern = &quot;abb&quot;
Output: [&quot;mee&quot;,&quot;aqq&quot;]
Explanation: &quot;mee&quot; matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -&gt; m, b -&gt; e, ...}. 
&quot;ccc&quot; does not match the pattern because {a -&gt; c, b -&gt; c, ...} is not a permutation,
since a and b map to the same letter.

Note:


	1 &lt;= words.length &lt;= 50
	1 &lt;= pattern.length = words[i].length&#xA0;&lt;= 20
