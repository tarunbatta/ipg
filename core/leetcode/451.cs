/*
451. Sort Characters By Frequency
Medium

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:
Input:
&quot;tree&quot;

Output:
&quot;eert&quot;

Explanation:
&apos;e&apos; appears twice while &apos;r&apos; and &apos;t&apos; both appear once.
So &apos;e&apos; must appear before both &apos;r&apos; and &apos;t&apos;. Therefore &quot;eetr&quot; is also a valid answer.



Example 2:
Input:
&quot;cccaaa&quot;

Output:
&quot;cccaaa&quot;

Explanation:
Both &apos;c&apos; and &apos;a&apos; appear three times, so &quot;aaaccc&quot; is also a valid answer.
Note that &quot;cacaca&quot; is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.



Example 3:
Input:
&quot;Aabb&quot;

Output:
&quot;bbAa&quot;

Explanation:
&quot;bbaA&quot; is also a valid answer, but &quot;Aabb&quot; is incorrect.
Note that &apos;A&apos; and &apos;a&apos; are treated as two different characters.
