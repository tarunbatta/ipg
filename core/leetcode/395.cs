Medium

Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.


Example 1:
Input:
s = &quot;aaabb&quot;, k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is &quot;aaa&quot;, as &apos;a&apos; is repeated 3 times.



Example 2:
Input:
s = &quot;ababbc&quot;, k = 2

Output:
