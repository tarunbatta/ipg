133. Clone Graph
Medium

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.


Example:

Input:
{
	"$id": "1",
	"neighbors": [{
		"$id": "2",
		"neighbors": [{
				"$ref": "1"
			},
			{
				"$id": "3",
				"neighbors": [{
					"$ref": "2"
				}, {
					"$id": "4",
					"neighbors": [{
						"$ref": "3"
					}, {
						"$ref": "1"
					}],
					"val": 4
				}],
				"val": 3
			}
		],
		"val": 2
	}, {
		"$ref": "4"
	}],
	"val": 1
}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.

Note:
	The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
	The undirected graph is a simple graph, which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
	Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have node p as neighbor too.
	You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
