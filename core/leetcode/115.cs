115. Distinct Subsequences
Hard

Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, &quot;ACE&quot; is a subsequence of &quot;ABCDE&quot; while &quot;AEC&quot; is not).

Example 1:

Input: S = &quot;rabbbit&quot;, T = &quot;rabbit&quot;
Output:&#xA0;3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate &quot;rabbit&quot; from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

Example 2:

Input: S = &quot;babgbag&quot;, T = &quot;bag&quot;
Output:&#xA0;5
Explanation:
