506. Relative Ranks
Easy

Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with the top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: &quot;Gold Medal&quot;, &quot;Silver Medal&quot; and &quot;Bronze Medal&quot;.

Example 1:
Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [&quot;Gold Medal&quot;, &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, &quot;Bronze Medal&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;]
Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so they got &quot;Gold Medal&quot;, &quot;Silver Medal&quot; and &quot;Bronze Medal&quot;. For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to their scores.



Note:

N is a positive integer and won&apos;t exceed 10,000.
All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.
