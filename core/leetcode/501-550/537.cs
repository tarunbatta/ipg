/*
537. Complex Number Multiplication
Medium

Given two strings representing two complex numbers.


You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.


Example 1:
Input: &quot;1+1i&quot;, &quot;1+1i&quot;
Output: &quot;0+2i&quot;
Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.



Example 2:
Input: &quot;1+-1i&quot;, &quot;1+-1i&quot;
Output: &quot;0+-2i&quot;
Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.



Note:

The input strings will not have extra blank.
The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.
