/*
938. Range Sum of BST
Easy

Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between L and R (inclusive).

The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

 


Example 1:

Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
Output: 32



Example 2:

Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
Output: 23


 

Note:


	The number of nodes in the tree is at most 10000.
	The final answer is guaranteed to be less than 2^31.
