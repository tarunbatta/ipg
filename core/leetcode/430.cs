430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List
Medium

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

Example:

Input:
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL

Output:
1-2-3-7-8-11-12-9-10-4-5-6-NULL


&#xA0;

Explanation for the above example:

Given the following multilevel doubly linked list:



&#xA0;

We should return the following flattened doubly linked list:

        public void Init() { }

        public Node Flatten(Node head) { }
    }
}
