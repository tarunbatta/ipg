657. Robot Return to Origin
Easy

There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.

The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D (down). If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Note: The way that the robot is &quot;facing&quot; is irrelevant. &quot;R&quot; will always make the robot move to the right once, &quot;L&quot; will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot&apos;s movement is the same for each move.

Example 1:

Input: &quot;UD&quot;
Output: true 
Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.


&#xA0;

Example 2:

Input: &quot;LL&quot;
Output: false
Explanation: The robot moves left twice. It ends up two &quot;moves&quot; to the left of the origin. We return false because it is not at the origin at the end of its moves.
