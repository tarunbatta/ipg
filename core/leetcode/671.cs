671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree
Easy

Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node&apos;s value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property&#xA0;root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val)&#xA0;always holds.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes&apos; value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

Example 1:

Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   5
     / \
    5   7

Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.


&#xA0;

Example 2:

Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   2

Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn&apos;t any second smallest value.
