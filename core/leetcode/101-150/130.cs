130. Surrounded Regions
Medium

Given a 2D board containing &apos;X&apos; and &apos;O&apos; (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by &apos;X&apos;.

A region is captured by flipping all &apos;O&apos;s into &apos;X&apos;s in that surrounded region.

Example:

X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X


After running your function, the board should be:

X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X


Explanation:

Surrounded regions shouldn&#x2019;t be on the border, which means that any &apos;O&apos;&#xA0;on the border of the board are not flipped to &apos;X&apos;. Any &apos;O&apos;&#xA0;that is not on the border and it is not connected to an &apos;O&apos;&#xA0;on the border will be flipped to &apos;X&apos;. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
