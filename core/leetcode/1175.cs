1175. Prime Arrangements
Easy

Return the number of permutations of 1 to n so that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed.)

(Recall that an integer&#xA0;is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers&#xA0;both smaller than it.)

Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

&#xA0;
Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: 12
Explanation: For example [1,2,5,4,3] is a valid permutation, but [5,2,3,4,1] is not because the prime number 5 is at index 1.


Example 2:

Input: n = 100
Output: 682289015


&#xA0;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100
