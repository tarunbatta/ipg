101. Symmetric Tree
Easy

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3


&#xA0;

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3


&#xA0;

Note:
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
