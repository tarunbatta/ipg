492. Construct the Rectangle
Easy

For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page&apos;s size. So, given a specific rectangular web page&#x2019;s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L &gt;= W.
3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.



Example:
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.



Note:

The given area won&apos;t exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
The web page&apos;s width and length you designed must be positive integers.
