194. Transpose File
Medium

Given a text file file.txt, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by the &apos; &apos; character.

Example:

If file.txt has the following content:

name age
alice 21
ryan 30


Output the following:

name alice ryan
age 21 30


&#xA0;

}
