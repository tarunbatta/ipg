/*
763. Partition Labels
Medium

A string S of lowercase letters is given.  We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.


Example 1:
Input: S = &quot;ababcbacadefegdehijhklij&quot;
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is &quot;ababcbaca&quot;, &quot;defegde&quot;, &quot;hijhklij&quot;.
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like &quot;ababcbacadefegde&quot;, &quot;hijhklij&quot; is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.



Note:
S will have length in range [1, 500].
S will consist of lowercase letters (&apos;a&apos; to &apos;z&apos;) only.
