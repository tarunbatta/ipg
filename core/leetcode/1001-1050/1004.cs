1004. Max Consecutive Ones III
Medium

Given an array A&#xA0;of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K&#xA0;values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s.&#xA0;

&#xA0;


Example 1:

Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.


Example 2:

Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.


&#xA0;

Note:


	1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 20000
	0 &lt;= K &lt;= A.length
	A[i] is 0 or 1&#xA0;
