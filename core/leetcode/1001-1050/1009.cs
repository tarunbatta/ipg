1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer
Easy

Every non-negative integer N&#xA0;has a binary representation.&#xA0; For example,&#xA0;5 can be represented as &quot;101&quot;&#xA0;in binary, 11 as &quot;1011&quot;&#xA0;in binary, and so on.&#xA0; Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any&#xA0;binary representation.

The complement&#xA0;of a binary representation&#xA0;is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.&#xA0; For example, the complement of &quot;101&quot; in binary is &quot;010&quot; in binary.

For a given number N in base-10, return the complement of it&apos;s binary representation as a&#xA0;base-10 integer.

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is &quot;101&quot; in binary, with complement &quot;010&quot; in binary, which is 2 in base-10.



Example 2:

Input: 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is &quot;111&quot; in binary, with complement &quot;000&quot; in binary, which is 0 in base-10.



Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is &quot;1010&quot; in binary, with complement &quot;0101&quot; in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
