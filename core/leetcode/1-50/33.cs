33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Medium

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm&apos;s runtime complexity must be in the order of&#xA0;O(log&#xA0;n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4


Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
