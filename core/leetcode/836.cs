836. Rectangle Overlap
Easy

A rectangle is&#xA0;represented as a&#xA0;list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where&#xA0;(x1, y1)&#xA0;are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and (x2,&#xA0;y2)&#xA0;are the coordinates of its top-right corner.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive.&#xA0; To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether&#xA0;they overlap.

Example 1:

Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
Output: true


Example 2:

Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
Output: false


Notes:


	Both rectangles rec1 and rec2 are lists of 4 integers.
	All coordinates in rectangles will be between&#xA0;-10^9 and 10^9.
