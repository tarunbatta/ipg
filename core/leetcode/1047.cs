/*
1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String
Easy

Given a string S of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing&#xA0;them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.&#xA0; It is guaranteed the answer is unique.

&#xA0;

Example 1:

Input: &quot;abbaca&quot;
Output: &quot;ca&quot;
Explanation: 
For example, in &quot;abbaca&quot; we could remove &quot;bb&quot; since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.&#xA0; The result of this move is that the string is &quot;aaca&quot;, of which only &quot;aa&quot; is possible, so the final string is &quot;ca&quot;.


&#xA0;

Note:


	1 &lt;= S.length &lt;= 20000
	S consists only of English lowercase letters.
