986. Interval List Intersections
Medium

Given two lists&#xA0;of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

(Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a &lt;= b) denotes&#xA0;the set of real numbers x with a &lt;= x &lt;= b.&#xA0; The&#xA0;intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.&#xA0; For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)


&#xA0;

Example 1:



Input: A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
Reminder: The inputs and the desired output are lists of Interval&#xA0;objects, and not arrays or lists.


&#xA0;

Note:


	0 &lt;= A.length &lt; 1000
	0 &lt;= B.length &lt; 1000
	0 &lt;= A[i].start, A[i].end, B[i].start, B[i].end &lt; 10^9
