/*
1048. Longest String Chain
Medium

Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.

Let&apos;s say word1 is a predecessor of word2&#xA0;if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in word1 to make it equal to word2.&#xA0; For example,&#xA0;&quot;abc&quot;&#xA0;is a predecessor of &quot;abac&quot;.

A word chain&#xA0;is a sequence of words [word_1, word_2, ..., word_k]&#xA0;with k &gt;= 1,&#xA0;where word_1 is a predecessor of word_2, word_2 is a predecessor of word_3, and so on.

Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

&#xA0;

Example 1:

Input: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;ba&quot;,&quot;bca&quot;,&quot;bda&quot;,&quot;bdca&quot;]
Output: 4
Explanation: one of the longest word chain is &quot;a&quot;,&quot;ba&quot;,&quot;bda&quot;,&quot;bdca&quot;.


&#xA0;

Note:


	1 &lt;= words.length &lt;= 1000
	1 &lt;= words[i].length &lt;= 16
	words[i] only consists of English lowercase letters.
