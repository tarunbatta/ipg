/*
1156. Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring
Medium

Given a string text, we are allowed to swap two of the characters in the string. Find the length of the longest substring with repeated characters.

&#xA0;
Example 1:

Input: text = &quot;ababa&quot;
Output: 3
Explanation: We can swap the first &apos;b&apos; with the last &apos;a&apos;, or the last &apos;b&apos; with the first &apos;a&apos;. Then, the longest repeated character substring is &quot;aaa&quot;, which its length is 3.


Example 2:

Input: text = &quot;aaabaaa&quot;
Output: 6
Explanation: Swap &apos;b&apos; with the last &apos;a&apos; (or the first &apos;a&apos;), and we get longest repeated character substring &quot;aaaaaa&quot;, which its length is 6.


Example 3:

Input: text = &quot;aaabbaaa&quot;
Output: 4


Example 4:

Input: text = &quot;aaaaa&quot;
Output: 5
Explanation: No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is &quot;aaaaa&quot;, length is 5.


Example 5:

Input: text = &quot;abcdef&quot;
Output: 1


&#xA0;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= text.length &lt;= 20000
	text consist of lowercase English characters only.
