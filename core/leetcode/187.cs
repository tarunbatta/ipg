187. Repeated DNA Sequences
Medium

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: &quot;ACGAATTCCG&quot;. When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

Example:

Input: s = &quot;AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT&quot;

Output: [&quot;AAAAACCCCC&quot;, &quot;CCCCCAAAAA&quot;]
