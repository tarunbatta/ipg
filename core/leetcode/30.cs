30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words
Hard

You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

Example 1:

Input:
  s = &quot;barfoothefoobarman&quot;,
  words = [&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are &quot;barfoor&quot; and &quot;foobar&quot; respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.


Example 2:

Input:
  s = &quot;wordgoodgoodgoodbestword&quot;,
  words = [&quot;word&quot;,&quot;good&quot;,&quot;best&quot;,&quot;word&quot;]
Output: []
