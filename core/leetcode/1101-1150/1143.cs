1143. Longest Common Subsequence
Medium

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, &quot;ace&quot; is a subsequence of &quot;abcde&quot; while &quot;aec&quot; is not).&#xA0;A common subsequence&#xA0;of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

&#xA0;

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

&#xA0;
Example 1:

Input: text1 = &quot;abcde&quot;, text2 = &quot;ace&quot; 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is &quot;ace&quot; and its length is 3.


Example 2:

Input: text1 = &quot;abc&quot;, text2 = &quot;abc&quot;
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is &quot;abc&quot; and its length is 3.


Example 3:

Input: text1 = &quot;abc&quot;, text2 = &quot;def&quot;
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.


&#xA0;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= text1.length &lt;= 1000
	1 &lt;= text2.length &lt;= 1000
	The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.
