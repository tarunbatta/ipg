925. Long Pressed Name
Easy

Your friend is typing his name&#xA0;into a keyboard.&#xA0; Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the typed&#xA0;characters of the keyboard.&#xA0; Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

&#xA0;

Example 1:

Input: name = &quot;alex&quot;, typed = &quot;aaleex&quot;

Example 2:

Input: name = &quot;saeed&quot;, typed = &quot;ssaaedd&quot;
