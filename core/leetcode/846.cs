Alice has a hand of cards, given as an array of integers.

Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size W, and consists of W consecutive cards.

Return true if and only if she can.

&#xA0;




Example 1:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice&apos;s hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].

Example 2:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice&apos;s hand can&apos;t be rearranged into groups of 4.

&#xA0;

Note:


	1 &lt;= hand.length &lt;= 10000
	0 &lt;= hand[i]&#xA0;&lt;= 10^9
	1 &lt;= W &lt;= hand.length
