275. H-Index II
Medium

Given an array of citations sorted&#xA0;in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher&apos;s h-index.

According to the&#xA0;definition of h-index on Wikipedia: &quot;A scientist has index&#xA0;h&#xA0;if&#xA0;h&#xA0;of his/her&#xA0;N&#xA0;papers have&#xA0;at least&#xA0;h&#xA0;citations each, and the other&#xA0;N &#x2212; h&#xA0;papers have&#xA0;no more than&#xA0;h&#xA0;citations each.&quot;

Example:

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
&#xA0;            Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
&#xA0;            two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

Note:

If there are several possible values for&#xA0;h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Follow up:


	This is a follow up problem to&#xA0;H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
	Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
