/*
17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
Medium

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.



Example:

Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].


Note:

Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.
