17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
Medium

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.



Example:

Input: &quot;23&quot;
Output: [&quot;ad&quot;, &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;af&quot;, &quot;bd&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, &quot;bf&quot;, &quot;cd&quot;, &quot;ce&quot;, &quot;cf&quot;].


Note:

Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.
