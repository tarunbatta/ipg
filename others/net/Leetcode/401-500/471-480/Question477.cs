    /// Total Hamming Distance
    /// https://leetcode.com/problems/total-hamming-distance/
    ///
    /// The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
    /// Now your job is to find the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the given numbers.
    ///
    /// Example:
    /// Input: 4, 14, 2
    /// Output: 6
    ///
    /// Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010
    /// (just showing the four bits relevant in this case). So the answer will be:
    /// HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
    ///
    /// Note:
    /// Elements of the given array are in the range of 0 to 10^9
    /// Length of the array will not exceed 10^4.
