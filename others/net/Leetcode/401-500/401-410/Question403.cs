    /// Frog Jump
    /// https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/
    ///
    /// A frog is crossing a river.
    /// The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone.
    /// The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.
    /// Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order,
    /// determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone.
    /// Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.
    /// If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units.
    /// Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
    ///
    /// Note:
    ///     The number of stones is >= 2 and is less than 1100.
    ///     Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer less than 231.
    ///     The first stone's position is always 0.
    ///
    /// Example 1:
    /// [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
    /// There are a total of 8 stones.
    /// The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
    /// third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
    /// The last stone at the 17th unit.
    /// Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping
    /// 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then
    /// 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone,
    /// 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
    ///
    /// Example 2:
    /// [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
    /// Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as
    /// the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
