    ///
    /// Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
    ///
    /// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w
    /// as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

    ///
    /// For example, the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
    /// Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
