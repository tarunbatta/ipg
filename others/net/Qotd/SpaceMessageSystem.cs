    /// Space Message System:
    /// You are designing a messaging system for a future space craft that will travel to the far reaches of our Galaxy.
    /// Messages will be sent back to Earth from the space craft and recipients on Earth can send replies back to the space craft that sent the message.
    ///
    /// After the user sends a message to Earth, they need to be given a good approximation of when they can expect to receive a response to their message.
    ///
    /// Write the program that will be responsible for outputting this approximation to the user on the space craft.
    ///
    /// Inputs:
    /// - The distance from earth (in miles) at the time the message is sent
    /// - The velocity (in miles/hour) at the time the message is sent.
    ///
    /// Output:
    /// - The total time (i.e. years, days, hours, minutes, seconds) that the user can expect a response.
    ///
    /// Assumptions:
    /// - The space craft is traveling in a straight line and at some constant speed for the entire duration of the message cycle.
    /// - The messages travel at the speed of light (let's just set it at 186,000 miles/second)
    /// - When a message is received on Earth, assume the time taken to send the response in negligible
    /// - The recipient on earth always responds to messages from the space craft
    /// - The space craft can travel very close to the speed of light
    /// - No wormholes or warped space
