    /// Stack of Plates: Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
    /// Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack
    /// exceeds some threshold.Implement a data structure SetOf Stacks that mimics
    /// this. SetOf Stacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a
    /// new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.SetOf Stacks.push() and
    /// SetOf Stacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack(that is, popO
    /// should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
    /// Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on
    /// a specific sub-stack.
