    /// Master Mind: The Game of Master Mind is played as follows:
    /// The computer has four slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red(R), yellow(V), green(G) or
    /// blue(B). For example, the computer might have RGGB(Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot
    /// #4 is blue).
    /// You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess YRGB.
    /// When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a "hit:' If you guess a color that exists
    /// but is in the wrong slot, you get a "pseudo-hit:' Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as a
    /// pseudo-hit.
    /// For example, if the actual solution is RGBY and you guess GGRR, you have one hit and one pseudo-hit.
    /// Write a method that, given a guess and a solution, returns the number of hits and pseudo-hits.
