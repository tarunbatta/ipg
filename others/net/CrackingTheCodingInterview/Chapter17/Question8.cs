    /// Circus Tower: A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one another's
    /// shoulders.For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter and lighter
    /// than the person below him or her.Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, write
    /// a method to compute the largest possible number of people in such a tower.
    /// EXAMPLE
    /// Input(ht, wt): (65, 100) (70, 150) (56, 90) (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110)
    /// Output: The longest tower is length 6 and includes from top to bottom:
