    /// Baby Names: Each year, the government releases a list of the 10000 most common baby names
    /// and their frequencies(the number of babies with that name). The only problem with this is that
    /// some names have multiple spellings. For example, "John" and "Jon" are essentially the same name
    /// but would be listed separately in the list. Given two lists, one of names/frequencies and the other
    /// of pairs of equivalent names, write an algorithm to print a new list of the true frequency of each
    /// name.Note that if John and Jon are synonyms, and Jon and Johnny are synonyms, then John and
    /// Johnny are synonyms. (It is both transitive and symmetric.) In the final list, any name can be used
    /// as the "real " name.
    /// EXAMPLE
    /// Input:
    /// Names: John(15), Jon(12), Chris(13), Kris(4), Christopher(19)
    /// Synonyms: (Jon, John), (John, Johnny), (Chris, Kris), (Chris, Christopher)
    /// Output: John(27), Kris(36)
