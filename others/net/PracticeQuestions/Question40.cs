    /// Find the number of islands
    /// Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands.
    ///
    /// This is an variation of the standard problem: “Counting number of connected components in a undirected graph”.
    /// Before we go to the problem, let us understand what is a connected component.
    /// A connected component of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which every two vertices are connected to each other by a path(s),
    /// and which is connected to no other vertices outside the subgraph.
    ///
    /// For example, the graph shown below has three connected components.
    ///
    /// A graph where all vertices are connected with each other, has exactly one connected component, consisting of the whole graph.
    /// Such graph with only one connected component is called as Strongly Connected Graph.
    ///
    /// The problem can be easily solved by applying DFS() on each component.In each DFS() call, a component or a sub-graph is visited.
    /// We will call DFS on the next un-visited component.The number of calls to DFS() gives the number of connected components.BFS can also be used.
    ///
    /// What is an island?
    /// A group of connected 1s forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands
    /// {1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
    /// {0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
    /// {1, 0, 0, 1, 1},
    /// {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    /// {1, 0, 1, 0, 1}
