/*
Area of Rectilinear Polygon
---------------------------------------
Find Rectangles:  Say you are given an Rectilinear polygon (all lines are either horizontal or vertical) shape in the form of a vertex list. Divide the polygon into rectangles and calculate the total area.

Input: (0,0), (0,90), (60,90), (60,120), (120,120), (120,80), (80,80), (80,10), (10,10), (10,0), (0,0)

One of the possible solutions is marked in the above using the grey line. Dividing this polygon into 10 smaller rectangles.
*Note:* What are the special case that you should be handling?
Followups:
* What if you needed to minimize the number of rectangles?
* What if you need to maximize the area of the cut pieces? A solution with 1 large piece and 100 smaller pieces is better than a solution with 50 medium sized pieces.
