/*
Appropriate Package Picker
---------------------------------------
You are given N of package. Each package has a weight and a destination (in miles from origin) [w,d]. A package delivery truck can carry a capacity of C. A truck starts from origin, collects as many package as it can (up to the total weight capacity of the truck), and then delivers, the packets. Your goal is to minimize the total distance travelled by the truck to deliver all the packages.
