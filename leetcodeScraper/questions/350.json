How would you optimize your algorithm?\n\tWhat if nums1&apos;s size is small compared to nums2&apos;s size? Which algorithm is better?\n\tWhat if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int[] Intersect(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {            }}"}
