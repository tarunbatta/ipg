{"number":"187","title":"Repeated DNA Sequences","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences","difficulty":"Medium","question":"All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: &quot;ACGAATTCCG&quot;. When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.\n\nWrite a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: s = &quot;AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT&quot;\n\nOutput: [&quot;AAAAACCCCC&quot;, &quot;CCCCCAAAAA&quot;]\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public IList<string> FindRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {            }}"}
