{"number":"167","title":"Two Sum II - Input array is sorted","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.\n\nThe function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tYour returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.\n\tYou may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.\n\n\nExample:\n\nInput: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int[] TwoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {            }}"}
