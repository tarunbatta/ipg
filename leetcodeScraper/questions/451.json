Therefore &quot;eetr&quot; is also a valid answer.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n&quot;cccaaa&quot;\n\nOutput:\n&quot;cccaaa&quot;\n\nExplanation:\nBoth &apos;c&apos; and &apos;a&apos; appear three times, so &quot;aaaccc&quot; is also a valid answer.\nNote that &quot;cacaca&quot; is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n&quot;Aabb&quot;\n\nOutput:\n&quot;bbAa&quot;\n\nExplanation:\n&quot;bbaA&quot; is also a valid answer, but &quot;Aabb&quot; is incorrect.\nNote that &apos;A&apos; and &apos;a&apos; are treated as two different characters.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public string FrequencySort(string s) {            }}"}
