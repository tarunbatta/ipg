The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.\n\nThe knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.\n\nSome of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0&apos;s) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight&apos;s health (positive integers).\n\nIn order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nWrite a function to determine the knight&apos;s minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.\n\nFor example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-&gt; RIGHT -&gt; DOWN -&gt; DOWN.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t-2 (K)\n\t\t\t-3\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t-5\n\t\t\t-10\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t30\n\t\t\t-5 (P)\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tThe knight&apos;s health has no upper bound.\n\tAny room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int CalculateMinimumHP(int[][] dungeon) {            }}"}
