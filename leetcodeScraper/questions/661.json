{"number":"661","title":"Image Smoother","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/image-smoother","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Given a 2D integer matrix M representing the gray scale of an image, you need to design a smoother to make the gray scale of each cell becomes the average gray scale (rounding down) of all the 8 surrounding cells and itself.  If a cell has less than 8 surrounding cells, then use as many as you can.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[[1,1,1],\n [1,0,1],\n [1,1,1]]\nOutput:\n[[0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0]]\nExplanation:\nFor the point (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2): floor(3/4) = floor(0.75) = 0\nFor the point (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1): floor(5/6) = floor(0.83333333) = 0\nFor the point (1,1): floor(8/9) = floor(0.88888889) = 0\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe value in the given matrix is in the range of [0, 255].\nThe length and width of the given matrix are in the range of [1, 150].\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int[][] ImageSmoother(int[][] M) {            }}"}
