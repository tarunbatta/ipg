{"number":"646","title":"Maximum Length of Pair Chain","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain","difficulty":"Medium","question":"\nYou are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.\n\n\n\nNow, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b &lt; c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion. \n\n\n\nGiven a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn&apos;t use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.\n\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The longest chain is [1,2] -&gt; [3,4]\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe number of given pairs will be in the range [1, 1000].\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int FindLongestChain(int[][] pairs) {            }}"}
