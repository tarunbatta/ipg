{"number":"1","title":"Two Sum","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.\n\nYou may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\n\nExample:\n\nGiven nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,\n\nBecause nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,\nreturn [0, 1].\n\n","code":"undefinedclass Solution {public:    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {            }};"}
