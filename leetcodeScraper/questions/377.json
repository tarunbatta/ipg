{"number":"377","title":"Combination Sum IV","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.\n\nExample:\n\nnums = [1, 2, 3]\ntarget = 4\n\nThe possible combination ways are:\n(1, 1, 1, 1)\n(1, 1, 2)\n(1, 2, 1)\n(1, 3)\n(2, 1, 1)\n(2, 2)\n(3, 1)\n\nNote that different sequences are counted as different combinations.\n\nTherefore the output is 7.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nFollow up:\nWhat if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?\nHow does it change the problem?\nWhat limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?\n\nCredits:\nSpecial thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int CombinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {            }}"}
