{"number":"543","title":"Diameter of Binary Tree","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree","difficulty":"Easy","question":"\nGiven a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.\n\n\n\nExample:\nGiven a binary tree \n          1\n         / \\\n        2   3\n       / \\     \n      4   5    \n\n\n\nReturn 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].\n\n\nNote:\nThe length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.\n","code":"undefined/** * Definition for a binary tree node. * public class TreeNode { *     public int val; *     public TreeNode left; *     public TreeNode right; *     public TreeNode(int x) { val = x; } * } */public class Solution {    public int DiameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {            }}"}
