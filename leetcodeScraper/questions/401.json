{"number":"401","title":"Binary Watch","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch","difficulty":"Easy","question":"A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).\nEach LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.\n\nFor example, the above binary watch reads &quot;3:25&quot;.\n\nGiven a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.\n\nExample:\nInput: n = 1Return: [&quot;1:00&quot;, &quot;2:00&quot;, &quot;4:00&quot;, &quot;8:00&quot;, &quot;0:01&quot;, &quot;0:02&quot;, &quot;0:04&quot;, &quot;0:08&quot;, &quot;0:16&quot;, &quot;0:32&quot;]\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe order of output does not matter.\nThe hour must not contain a leading zero, for example &quot;01:00&quot; is not valid, it should be &quot;1:00&quot;.\nThe minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example &quot;10:2&quot; is not valid, it should be &quot;10:02&quot;.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public IList<string> ReadBinaryWatch(int num) {            }}"}
