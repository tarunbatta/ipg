{"number":"407","title":"Trapping Rain Water II","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water-ii","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Given an m x n matrix of positive integers representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to trap after raining.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\nBoth m and n are less than 110. The height of each unit cell is greater than 0 and is less than 20,000.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample:\n\nGiven the following 3x6 height map:\n[\n  [1,4,3,1,3,2],\n  [3,2,1,3,2,4],\n  [2,3,3,2,3,1]\n]\n\nReturn 4.\n\n\n\n\nThe above image represents the elevation map [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]] before the rain.\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\nAfter the rain, water is trapped between the blocks. The total volume of water trapped is 4.\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int TrapRainWater(int[][] heightMap) {            }}"}
