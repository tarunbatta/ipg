{"number":"134","title":"Gas Station","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station","difficulty":"Medium","question":"There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].\n\nYou have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.\n\nReturn the starting gas station&apos;s index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tIf there exists a&#xA0;solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.\n\tBoth input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.\n\tEach element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: \ngas  = [1,2,3,4,5]\ncost = [3,4,5,1,2]\n\nOutput: 3\n\nExplanation:\nStart at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\nTravel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8\nTravel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7\nTravel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6\nTravel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5\nTravel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.\nTherefore, return 3 as the starting index.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: \ngas  = [2,3,4]\ncost = [3,4,3]\n\nOutput: -1\n\nExplanation:\nYou can&apos;t start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.\nLet&apos;s start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\nTravel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3\nTravel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3\nYou cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.\nTherefore, you can&apos;t travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int CanCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {            }}"}
