{"number":"532","title":"K-diff Pairs in an Array","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/k-diff-pairs-in-an-array","difficulty":"Easy","question":"\nGiven an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array. Here a k-diff pair is defined as an integer pair (i, j), where i and j are both numbers in the array and their absolute difference is k.\n\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 1\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: There are four 1-diff pairs in the array, (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 5).\n\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [1, 3, 1, 5, 4], k = 0\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: There is one 0-diff pair in the array, (1, 1).\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe pairs (i, j) and (j, i) count as the same pair.\nThe length of the array won&apos;t exceed 10,000.\nAll the integers in the given input belong to the range: [-1e7, 1e7].\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int FindPairs(int[] nums, int k) {            }}"}
