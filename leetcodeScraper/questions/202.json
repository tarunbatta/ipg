{"number":"202","title":"Happy Number","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Write an algorithm to determine if a number is &quot;happy&quot;.\n\nA happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.\n\nExample:&#xA0;\n\nInput: 19\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \n12 + 92 = 82\n82 + 22 = 68\n62 + 82 = 100\n12 + 02 + 02 = 1\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool IsHappy(int n) {            }}"}
