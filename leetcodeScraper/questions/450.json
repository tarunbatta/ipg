{"number":"450","title":"Delete Node in a BST","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.\n\nBasically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:\n\nSearch for a node to remove.\nIf the node is found, delete the node.\n\n\n\nNote: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).\n\nExample:\nroot = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]\nkey = 3\n\n    5\n   / \\\n  3   6\n / \\   \\\n2   4   7\n\nGiven key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.\n\nOne valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.\n\n    5\n   / \\\n  4   6\n /     \\\n2       7\n\nAnother valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].\n\n    5\n   / \\\n  2   6\n   \\   \\\n    4   7\n\n","code":"undefined/** * Definition for a binary tree node. * public class TreeNode { *     public int val; *     public TreeNode left; *     public TreeNode right; *     public TreeNode(int x) { val = x; } * } */public class Solution {    public TreeNode DeleteNode(TreeNode root, int key) {            }}"}
