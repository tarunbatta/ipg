How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?\n","code":"undefined/** * Definition for a binary tree node. * public class TreeNode { *     public int val; *     public TreeNode left; *     public TreeNode right; *     public TreeNode(int x) { val = x; } * } */public class Solution {    public int KthSmallest(TreeNode root, int k) {            }}"}
