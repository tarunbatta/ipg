{"number":"503","title":"Next Greater Element II","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii","difficulty":"Medium","question":"\nGiven a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn&apos;t exist, output -1 for this number.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [1,2,1]\nOutput: [2,-1,2]\nExplanation: The first 1&apos;s next greater number is 2; The number 2 can&apos;t find next greater number; The second 1&apos;s next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe length of given array won&apos;t exceed 10000.\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int[] NextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {            }}"}
