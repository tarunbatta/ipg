{"number":"414","title":"Third Maximum Number","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [3, 2, 1]\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExplanation: The third maximum is 1.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [1, 2]\n\nOutput: 2\n\nExplanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [2, 2, 3, 1]\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExplanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.\nBoth numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int ThirdMax(int[] nums) {            }}"}
