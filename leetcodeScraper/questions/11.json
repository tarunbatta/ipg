{"number":"11","title":"Container With Most Water","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an&#xA0;, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.\n\nNote:&#xA0;You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\nThe above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain&#xA0;is 49. \n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample:\n\nInput: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]\nOutput: 49\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int MaxArea(int[] height) {            }}"}
