{"number":"330","title":"Patching Array","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3], n = 6\nOutput: 1 \nExplanation:\nCombinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.\nNow if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].\nPossible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].\nSo we only need 1 patch.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,2], n = 5\nOutput: 0\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int MinPatches(int[] nums, int n) {            }}"}
