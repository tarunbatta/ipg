{"number":"133","title":"Clone Graph","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given&#xA0;a reference of a node in a&#xA0;connected&#xA0;undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nInput:\n{&quot;$id&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;neighbors&quot;:[{&quot;$id&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;neighbors&quot;:[{&quot;$ref&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},{&quot;$id&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;neighbors&quot;:[{&quot;$ref&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},{&quot;$id&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;neighbors&quot;:[{&quot;$ref&quot;:&quot;3&quot;},{&quot;$ref&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}],&quot;val&quot;:4}],&quot;val&quot;:3}],&quot;val&quot;:2},{&quot;$ref&quot;:&quot;4&quot;}],&quot;val&quot;:1}\n\nExplanation:\nNode 1&apos;s value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.\nNode 2&apos;s value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.\nNode 3&apos;s value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.\nNode 4&apos;s value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.\n\tThe undirected&#xA0;graph is a simple graph,&#xA0;which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.\n\tSince the graph is undirected, if node p&#xA0;has node q&#xA0;as&#xA0;neighbor, then node q&#xA0;must have node p&#xA0;as neighbor too.\n\tYou must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.\n\n","code":"undefined/*// Definition for a Node.public class Node {    public int val;    public IList<Node> neighbors;​    public Node(){}    public Node(int _val,IList<Node> _neighbors) {        val = _val;        neighbors = _neighbors;}*/public class Solution {    public Node CloneGraph(Node node) {            }}"}
