{"number":"447","title":"Number of Boomerangs","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-boomerangs","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a &quot;boomerang&quot; is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).\n\nFind the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]\n\nOutput:\n2\n\nExplanation:\nThe two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]\n\n\n&#xA0;\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int NumberOfBoomerangs(int[][] points) {            }}"}
