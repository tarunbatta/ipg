{"number":"312","title":"Burst Balloons","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.\n\nFind the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tYou may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.\n\t0 &#x2264; n &#x2264; 500, 0 &#x2264; nums[i] &#x2264; 100\n\n\nExample:\n\nInput: [3,1,5,8]\nOutput: 167 \nExplanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --&gt; [3,5,8] --&gt;   [3,8]   --&gt;  [8]  --&gt; []\n&#xA0;            coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int MaxCoins(int[] nums) {            }}"}
