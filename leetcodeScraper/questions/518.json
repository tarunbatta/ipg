{"number":"518","title":"Coin Change 2","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-2","difficulty":"Medium","question":"You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.\n\n\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:\n5=5\n5=2+2+1\n5=2+1+1+1\n5=1+1+1+1+1\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: amount = 3, coins = [2]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: amount = 10, coins = [10] \nOutput: 1\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\nYou can assume that\n\n\n\t0 &lt;= amount &lt;= 5000\n\t1 &lt;= coin &lt;= 5000\n\tthe number of coins is less than 500\n\tthe answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int Change(int amount, int[] coins) {            }}"}
