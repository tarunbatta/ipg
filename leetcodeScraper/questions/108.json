{"number":"108","title":"Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.\n\nFor this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.\n\nExample:\n\nGiven the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],\n\nOne possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:\n\n      0\n     / \\\n   -3   9\n   /   /\n -10  5\n\n","code":"undefined/** * Definition for a binary tree node. * public class TreeNode { *     public int val; *     public TreeNode left; *     public TreeNode right; *     public TreeNode(int x) { val = x; } * } */public class Solution {    public TreeNode SortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {            }}"}
