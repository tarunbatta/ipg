{"number":"399","title":"Evaluate Division","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables represented as strings, and k is a real number (floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.\n\nExample:\nGiven  a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.\nqueries are:  a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .\nreturn  [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].\n\nThe input is:  vector&lt;pair&lt;string, string&gt;&gt; equations, vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; values, vector&lt;pair&lt;string, string&gt;&gt; queries , where equations.size() == values.size(), and the values are positive. This represents the equations. Return  vector&lt;double&gt;.\n\nAccording to the example above:\n\nequations = [ [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], [&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] ],\nvalues = [2.0, 3.0],\nqueries = [ [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], [&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;], [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;], [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;], [&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;] ]. \n\n&#xA0;\n\nThe input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public double[] CalcEquation(IList<IList<string>> equations, double[] values, IList<IList<string>> queries) {            }}"}
