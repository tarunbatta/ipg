{"number":"48","title":"Rotate Image","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image","difficulty":"Medium","question":"You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.\n\nRotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).\n\nNote:\n\nYou have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.\n\nExample 1:\n\nGiven input matrix = \n[\n  [1,2,3],\n  [4,5,6],\n  [7,8,9]\n],\n\nrotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:\n[\n  [7,4,1],\n  [8,5,2],\n  [9,6,3]\n]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nGiven input matrix =\n[\n  [ 5, 1, 9,11],\n  [ 2, 4, 8,10],\n  [13, 3, 6, 7],\n  [15,14,12,16]\n], \n\nrotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:\n[\n  [15,13, 2, 5],\n  [14, 3, 4, 1],\n  [12, 6, 8, 9],\n  [16, 7,10,11]\n]\n\n","code":"public class Solution {    public void Rotate(int[][] matrix) {            }}"}
