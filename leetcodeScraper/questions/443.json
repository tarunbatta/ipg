{"number":"443","title":"String Compression","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.\n\nThe length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.\n\nEvery element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.\n\nAfter you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.\n&#xA0;\n\nFollow up:\nCould you solve it using only O(1) extra space?\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;c&quot;]\n\nOutput:\nReturn 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;3&quot;]\n\nExplanation:\n&quot;aa&quot; is replaced by &quot;a2&quot;. &quot;bb&quot; is replaced by &quot;b2&quot;. &quot;ccc&quot; is replaced by &quot;c3&quot;.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n[&quot;a&quot;]\n\nOutput:\nReturn 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: [&quot;a&quot;]\n\nExplanation:\nNothing is replaced.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]\n\nOutput:\nReturn 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;].\n\nExplanation:\nSince the character &quot;a&quot; does not repeat, it is not compressed. &quot;bbbbbbbbbbbb&quot; is replaced by &quot;b12&quot;.\nNotice each digit has it&apos;s own entry in the array.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tAll characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].\n\t1 &lt;= len(chars) &lt;= 1000.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int Compress(char[] chars) {            }}"}
