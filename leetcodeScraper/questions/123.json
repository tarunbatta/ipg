{"number":"123","title":"Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.\n\nDesign an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.\n\nNote:&#xA0;You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.\n&#xA0;            Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.\n&#xA0;            Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are\n&#xA0;            engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [7,6,4,3,1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int MaxProfit(int[] prices) {            }}"}
