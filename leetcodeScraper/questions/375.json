The game is as follows:\n\nI pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.\n\nEvery time you guess wrong, I&apos;ll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.\n\nHowever, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.\n\nExample:\n\nn = 10, I pick 8.\n\nFirst round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it&apos;s higher. You pay $5.\nSecond round: You guess 7, I tell you that it&apos;s higher. You pay $7.\nThird round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it&apos;s lower. You pay $9.\n\nGame over. 8 is the number I picked.\n\nYou end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.\n\n\nGiven a particular n &#x2265; 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int GetMoneyAmount(int n) {            }}"}
