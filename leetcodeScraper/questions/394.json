{"number":"394","title":"Decode String","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.\n\nThe encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.\n\nYou may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.\n\nFurthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won&apos;t be input like 3a or 2[4].\n\nExamples:\n\ns = &quot;3[a]2[bc]&quot;, return &quot;aaabcbc&quot;.\ns = &quot;3[a2[c]]&quot;, return &quot;accaccacc&quot;.\ns = &quot;2[abc]3[cd]ef&quot;, return &quot;abcabccdcdcdef&quot;.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public string DecodeString(string s) {            }}"}
