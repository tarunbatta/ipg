{"number":"25","title":"Reverse Nodes in k-Group","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.\n\nk is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nGiven this linked list: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5\n\nFor k = 2, you should return: 2-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;3-&gt;5\n\nFor k = 3, you should return: 3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;5\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tOnly constant extra memory is allowed.\n\tYou may not alter the values in the list&apos;s nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.\n\n","code":"undefined/** * Definition for singly-linked list. * public class ListNode { *     public int val; *     public ListNode next; *     public ListNode(int x) { val = x; } * } */public class Solution {    public ListNode ReverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {            }}"}
