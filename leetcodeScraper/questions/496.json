{"number":"496","title":"Next Greater Element I","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i","difficulty":"Easy","question":"\nYou are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1&#x2019;s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1&apos;s elements in the corresponding places of nums2. \n\n\n\nThe Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].\nOutput: [-1,3,-1]\nExplanation:\n    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.\n    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.\n    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].\nOutput: [3,-1]\nExplanation:\n    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.\n    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nAll elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.\nThe length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int[] NextGreaterElement(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {            }}"}
