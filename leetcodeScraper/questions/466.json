{"number":"466","title":"Count The Repetitions","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-repetitions","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Define S = [s,n] as the string S which consists of n connected strings s. For example, [&quot;abc&quot;, 3] =&quot;abcabcabc&quot;. \nOn the other hand, we define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1. For example, &#x201C;abc&#x201D;  can be obtained from &#x201C;abdbec&#x201D; based on our definition, but it can not be obtained from &#x201C;acbbe&#x201D;.\nYou are given two non-empty strings s1 and s2 (each at most 100 characters long) and two integers 0 &#x2264; n1 &#x2264; 106 and 1 &#x2264; n2 &#x2264; 106. Now consider the strings S1 and S2, where S1=[s1,n1] and S2=[s2,n2]. Find the maximum integer M such that [S2,M] can be obtained from S1.\n\nExample:\nInput:\ns1=&quot;acb&quot;, n1=4\ns2=&quot;ab&quot;, n2=2\n\nReturn:\n2\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int GetMaxRepetitions(string s1, int n1, string s2, int n2) {            }}"}
