The battleships are represented with &apos;X&apos;s, empty slots are represented with &apos;.&apos;s. You may assume the following rules:\n\n\nYou receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.\nBattleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.\nAt least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.\n\n\nExample:\nX..X\n...X\n...X\n\nIn the above board there are 2 battleships.\n\nInvalid Example:\n...X\nXXXX\n...X\n\nThis is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.\n\nFollow up:Could you do it in one-pass, using only O(1) extra memory and without modifying the value of the board?","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int CountBattleships(char[][] board) {            }}"}
