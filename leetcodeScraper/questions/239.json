{"number":"239","title":"Sliding Window Maximum","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3\nOutput: [3,3,5,5,6,7] \nExplanation: \n\nWindow position                Max\n---------------               -----\n[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3\n 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3\n 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5\n 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5\n 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6\n 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7\n\n\nNote: \nYou may assume k is always valid, 1 &#x2264; k &#x2264; input array&apos;s size for non-empty array.\n\nFollow up:\nCould you solve it in linear time?","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int[] MaxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {            }}"}
