{"number":"129","title":"Sum Root to Leaf Numbers","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.\n\nAn example is the root-to-leaf path 1-&gt;2-&gt;3 which represents the number 123.\n\nFind the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.\n\nNote:&#xA0;A leaf is a node with no children.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: [1,2,3]\n    1\n   / \\\n  2   3\nOutput: 25\nExplanation:\nThe root-to-leaf path 1-&gt;2 represents the number 12.\nThe root-to-leaf path 1-&gt;3 represents the number 13.\nTherefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [4,9,0,5,1]\n    4\n   / \\\n  9   0\n&#xA0;/ \\\n5   1\nOutput: 1026\nExplanation:\nThe root-to-leaf path 4-&gt;9-&gt;5 represents the number 495.\nThe root-to-leaf path 4-&gt;9-&gt;1 represents the number 491.\nThe root-to-leaf path 4-&gt;0 represents the number 40.\nTherefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.\n","code":"undefined/** * Definition for a binary tree node. * public class TreeNode { *     public int val; *     public TreeNode left; *     public TreeNode right; *     public TreeNode(int x) { val = x; } * } */public class Solution {    public int SumNumbers(TreeNode root) {            }}"}
