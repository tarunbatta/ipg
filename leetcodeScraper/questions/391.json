{"number":"391","title":"Perfect Rectangle","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-rectangle","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Given N axis-aligned rectangles where N &gt; 0, determine if they all together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.\n\nEach rectangle is represented as a bottom-left point and a top-right point. For example, a unit square is represented as [1,1,2,2]. (coordinate of bottom-left point is (1, 1) and top-right point is (2, 2)).\n\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nrectangles = [\n  [1,1,3,3],\n  [3,1,4,2],\n  [3,2,4,4],\n  [1,3,2,4],\n  [2,3,3,4]\n]\n\nReturn true. All 5 rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nrectangles = [\n  [1,1,2,3],\n  [1,3,2,4],\n  [3,1,4,2],\n  [3,2,4,4]\n]\n\nReturn false. Because there is a gap between the two rectangular regions.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nrectangles = [\n  [1,1,3,3],\n  [3,1,4,2],\n  [1,3,2,4],\n  [3,2,4,4]\n]\n\nReturn false. Because there is a gap in the top center.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nrectangles = [\n  [1,1,3,3],\n  [3,1,4,2],\n  [1,3,2,4],\n  [2,2,4,4]\n]\n\nReturn false. Because two of the rectangles overlap with each other.\n\n\n&#xA0;","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool IsRectangleCover(int[][] rectangles) {            }}"}
