{"number":"81","title":"Search in Rotated Sorted Array II","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.\n\n(i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).\n\nYou are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0\nOutput: true\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3\nOutput: false\n\nFollow up:\n\n\n\tThis is a follow up problem to&#xA0;Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may contain duplicates.\n\tWould this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool Search(int[] nums, int target) {            }}"}
