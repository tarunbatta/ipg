This is a great question to ask during an interview.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C&apos;s&#xA0;strstr() and Java&apos;s&#xA0;indexOf().\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int StrStr(string haystack, string needle) {            }}"}
