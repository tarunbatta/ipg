{"number":"207","title":"Course Schedule","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule","difficulty":"Medium","question":"There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.\n\nSome courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]\n\nGiven the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 2, [[1,0]] \nOutput: true\nExplanation:&#xA0;There are a total of 2 courses to take. \n&#xA0;            To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation:&#xA0;There are a total of 2 courses to take. \n&#xA0;            To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should\n&#xA0;            also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tThe input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.\n\tYou may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool CanFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {            }}"}
