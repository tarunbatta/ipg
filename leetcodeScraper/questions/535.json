{"number":"535","title":"Encode and Decode TinyURL","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.\n\nTinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.\n\nDesign the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Codec {​    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL    public string encode(string longUrl) {            }​    // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.    public string decode(string shortUrl) {            }}​// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:// Codec codec = new Codec();// codec.decode(codec.encode(url));"}
