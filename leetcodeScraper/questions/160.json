{"number":"160","title":"Intersection of Two Linked Lists","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.\n\nFor example, the following two linked lists:\n\n\nbegin to intersect at node c1.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3\nOutput: Reference of the node with value = 8\nInput Explanation: The intersected node&apos;s value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal&#xA0;= 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1\nOutput: Reference of the node with value = 2\nInput Explanation:&#xA0;The intersected node&apos;s value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2\nOutput: null\nInput Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.\nExplanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\tIf the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.\n\tThe linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.\n\tYou may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\n\tYour code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.\n\n","code":"undefined/** * Definition for singly-linked list. * public class ListNode { *     public int val; *     public ListNode next; *     public ListNode(int x) { val = x; } * } */public class Solution {    public ListNode GetIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {            }}"}
