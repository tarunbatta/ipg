{"number":"637","title":"Average of Levels in Binary Tree","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n    3\n   / \\\n  9  20\n    /  \\\n   15   7\nOutput: [3, 14.5, 11]\nExplanation:\nThe average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe range of node&apos;s value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.\n\n","code":"undefined/** * Definition for a binary tree node. * public class TreeNode { *     public int val; *     public TreeNode left; *     public TreeNode right; *     public TreeNode(int x) { val = x; } * } */public class Solution {    public IList<double> AverageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {            }}"}
