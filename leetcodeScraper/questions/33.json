{"number":"33","title":"Search in Rotated Sorted Array","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.\n\n(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).\n\nYou are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.\n\nYou may assume no duplicate exists in the array.\n\nYour algorithm&apos;s runtime complexity must be in the order of&#xA0;O(log&#xA0;n).\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0\nOutput: 4\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3\nOutput: -1\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int Search(int[] nums, int target) {            }}"}
