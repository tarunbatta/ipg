{"number":"332","title":"Reconstruct Itinerary","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tIf there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary [&quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;LGA&quot;] has a smaller lexical order than [&quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;LGB&quot;].\n\tAll airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).\n\tYou may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [[&quot;MUC&quot;, &quot;LHR&quot;], [&quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;MUC&quot;], [&quot;SFO&quot;, &quot;SJC&quot;], [&quot;LHR&quot;, &quot;SFO&quot;]]\nOutput: [&quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;MUC&quot;, &quot;LHR&quot;, &quot;SFO&quot;, &quot;SJC&quot;]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [[&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;],[&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;],[&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;],[&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;JFK&quot;],[&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;]]\nOutput: [&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;]\nExplanation: Another possible reconstruction is [&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;].\n&#xA0;            But it is larger in lexical order.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public IList<string> FindItinerary(IList<IList<string>> tickets) {            }}"}
