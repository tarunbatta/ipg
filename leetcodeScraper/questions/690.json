{"number":"690","title":"Employee Importance","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-importance","difficulty":"Easy","question":"You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee&apos;s unique id, his importance value and his direct subordinates&apos; id.\n\nFor example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct.\n\nNow given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all his subordinates.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1\nOutput: 11\nExplanation:\nEmployee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tOne employee has at most one direct leader and may have several subordinates.\n\tThe maximum number of employees won&apos;t exceed 2000.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n","code":"undefined/*// Employee infoclass Employee {public:    // It's the unique ID of each node.    // unique id of this employee    int id;    // the importance value of this employee    int importance;    // the id of direct subordinates    vector<int> subordinates;};*/class Solution {public:    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {            }};"}
