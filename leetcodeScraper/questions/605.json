{"number":"605","title":"Can Place Flowers","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.\n\nGiven a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1\nOutput: True\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2\nOutput: False\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe input array won&apos;t violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.\nThe input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].\nn is a non-negative integer which won&apos;t exceed the input array size.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool CanPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {            }}"}
