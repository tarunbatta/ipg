{"number":"526","title":"Beautiful Arrangement","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 &lt;= i &lt;= N) in this array:\n\n\n\tThe number at the ith position is divisible by i.\n\ti is divisible by the number at the ith position.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNow given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \n\nThe first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:\n\nNumber at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).\n\nNumber at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).\n\nThe second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:\n\nNumber at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).\n\nNumber at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tN is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int CountArrangement(int N) {            }}"}
