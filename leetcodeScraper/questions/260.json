{"number":"260","title":"Single Number III","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.\n\nExample:\n\nInput:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]\nOutput: [3,5]\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tThe order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.\n\tYour algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int[] SingleNumber(int[] nums) {            }}"}
