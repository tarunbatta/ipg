{"number":"75","title":"Sort Colors","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place&#xA0;so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.\n\nHere, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.\n\nNote:&#xA0;You are not suppose to use the library&apos;s sort function for this problem.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: [2,0,2,1,1,0]\nOutput: [0,0,1,1,2,2]\n\nFollow up:\n\n\n\tA rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.\n\tFirst, iterate the array counting number of 0&apos;s, 1&apos;s, and 2&apos;s, then overwrite array with total number of 0&apos;s, then 1&apos;s and followed by 2&apos;s.\n\tCould you come up with a&#xA0;one-pass algorithm using only constant space?\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public void SortColors(int[] nums) {            }}"}
