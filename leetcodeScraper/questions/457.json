{"number":"457","title":"Circular Array Loop","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-array-loop","difficulty":"Medium","question":"You are given a circular array nums of positive and negative integers. If a number k at an index is positive, then move forward k steps. Conversely, if it&apos;s negative (-k), move backward k&#xA0;steps. Since the array is circular, you may assume that the last element&apos;s next element is the first element, and the first element&apos;s previous element is the last element.\n\nDetermine if there is a loop (or a cycle) in nums. A cycle must start and end at the same index and the cycle&apos;s length &gt; 1. Furthermore, movements in a cycle must all follow a single direction. In other words, a cycle must not consist of both forward and backward movements.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [2,-1,1,2,2]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: There is a cycle, from index 0 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 0. The cycle&apos;s length is 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [-1,2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The movement from index 1 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 1 ... is not a cycle, because the cycle&apos;s length is 1. By definition the cycle&apos;s length must be greater than 1.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [-2,1,-1,-2,-2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The movement from index 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 -&gt; ... is not a cycle, because movement from index 1 -&gt; 2 is a forward movement, but movement from index 2 -&gt; 1 is a backward movement. All movements in a cycle must follow a single direction.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t-1000 &#x2264;&#xA0;nums[i] &#x2264;&#xA0;1000\n\tnums[i] &#x2260;&#xA0;0\n\t1 &#x2264;&#xA0;nums.length &#x2264; 5000\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nFollow up:\n\nCould you solve it in O(n) time complexity and&#xA0;O(1) extra space complexity?","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool CircularArrayLoop(int[] nums) {            }}"}
