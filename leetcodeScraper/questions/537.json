{"number":"537","title":"Complex Number Multiplication","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/complex-number-multiplication","difficulty":"Medium","question":"\nGiven two strings representing two complex numbers.\n\n\nYou need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: &quot;1+1i&quot;, &quot;1+1i&quot;\nOutput: &quot;0+2i&quot;\nExplanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: &quot;1+-1i&quot;, &quot;1+-1i&quot;\nOutput: &quot;0+-2i&quot;\nExplanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe input strings will not have extra blank.\nThe input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public string ComplexNumberMultiply(string a, string b) {            }}"}
