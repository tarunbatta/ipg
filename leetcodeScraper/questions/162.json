{"number":"162","title":"Find Peak Element","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element","difficulty":"Medium","question":"A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.\n\nGiven an input array nums, where nums[i] &#x2260; nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.\n\nThe array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.\n\nYou may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -&#x221E;.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]\nOutput: 1 or 5 \nExplanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, \n&#xA0;            or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.\n\n\nNote:\n\nYour solution should be in logarithmic complexity.\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int FindPeakElement(int[] nums) {            }}"}
