{"number":"392","title":"Is Subsequence","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence","difficulty":"Easy","question":"\nGiven a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.\n\n\n\nYou may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (&lt;=100).\n\n\n\nA subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, &quot;ace&quot; is a subsequence of &quot;abcde&quot; while &quot;aec&quot; is not).\n\n\nExample 1:\ns = &quot;abc&quot;, t = &quot;ahbgdc&quot;\n\n\nReturn true.\n\n\nExample 2:\ns = &quot;axc&quot;, t = &quot;ahbgdc&quot;\n\n\nReturn false.\n\n\nFollow up:\nIf there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k &gt;= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?\n\nCredits:Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool IsSubsequence(string s, string t) {            }}"}
