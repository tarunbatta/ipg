{"number":"629","title":"K Inverse Pairs Array","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/k-inverse-pairs-array","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Given two integers n and k, find how many different arrays consist of numbers from 1 to n such that there are exactly k inverse pairs.\n\nWe define an inverse pair as following: For ith and jth element in the array, if i &lt; j and a[i] &gt; a[j] then it&apos;s an inverse pair; Otherwise, it&apos;s not.\n\nSince the answer may be very large, the answer should be modulo 109 + 7.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3, k = 0\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nOnly the array [1,2,3] which consists of numbers from 1 to 3 has exactly 0 inverse pair.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 3, k = 1\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nThe array [1,3,2] and [2,1,3] have exactly 1 inverse pair.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tThe integer n is in the range [1, 1000] and k is in the range [0, 1000].\n\n\n&#xA0;\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int KInversePairs(int n, int k) {            }}"}
