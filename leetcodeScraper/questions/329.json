{"number":"329","title":"Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.\n\nFrom each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = \n[\n  [9,9,4],\n  [6,6,8],\n  [2,1,1]\n] \nOutput: 4 \nExplanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = \n[\n  [3,4,5],\n  [3,2,6],\n  [2,2,1]\n] \nOutput: 4 \nExplanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int LongestIncreasingPath(int[][] matrix) {            }}"}
