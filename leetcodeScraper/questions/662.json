{"number":"662","title":"Maximum Width of Binary Tree","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are null.\n\nThe width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: \n\n           1\n         /   \\\n        3     2\n       / \\     \\  \n      5   3     9 \n\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: \n\n          1\n         /  \n        3    \n       / \\       \n      5   3     \n\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2 (5,3).\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: \n\n          1\n         / \\\n        3   2 \n       /        \n      5      \n\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length 2 (3,2).\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: \n\n          1\n         / \\\n        3   2\n       /     \\  \n      5       9 \n     /         \\\n    6           7\nOutput: 8\nExplanation:The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the length 8 (6,null,null,null,null,null,null,7).\n\n\n\n\nNote: Answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer.\n","code":"undefined/** * Definition for a binary tree node. * public class TreeNode { *     public int val; *     public TreeNode left; *     public TreeNode right; *     public TreeNode(int x) { val = x; } * } */public class Solution {    public int WidthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {            }}"}
