{"number":"492","title":"Construct the Rectangle","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle","difficulty":"Easy","question":"\nFor a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page&apos;s size. So, given a specific rectangular web page&#x2019;s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.\n2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L &gt;= W.\n3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.\n\nYou need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.\n\n\n\nExample:\nInput: 4\nOutput: [2, 2]\nExplanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. \nBut according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe given area won&apos;t exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer\nThe web page&apos;s width and length you designed must be positive integers.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int[] ConstructRectangle(int area) {            }}"}
