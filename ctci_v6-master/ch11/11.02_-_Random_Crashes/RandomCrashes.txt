1. Our program may depend on some element of randomness: user input, randomly generated number, time, etc
2. If our program is using an uninitialized variable, it could be accessing data it isn't supposed to (same with accessing something outside of an arrays indices)
3. Our program may be using an external library that crashes all the time.
4. Stack overflows
