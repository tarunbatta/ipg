6.1 You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an accurate measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.
-------

Take one pill from Bottle #1, two pills from Bottle #2, three pills from Bottle #3, etc. Weigh these pills together. If all the pills were one gram each, then the scale would read 210 grams (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 20 = 210) or (20 * 21)/2 = 210. Any weight over 210 must come from the heavier pills.

Then use this formula to find the bottle number. ((weight - 210) / 0.1). So if the set of pills weighed 211.5 grams, then bottle #15 would have the 1.1g pills.
