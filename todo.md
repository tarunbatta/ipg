Sudoku problems

Design a stack of integers in which we can get its minimum number with a function Min. The time complexity of Min, Push, and Pop should be all O(1).  The interesting part is to design such stack without using any extra auxiliary memory/data structure. You can use a constant variable though.

QOTD: given an array that contains zero, positive and negative integers. find the product of the maximum product subarray ? O(n) time and constant space.

Given a set of non-overlapping & sorted intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

Example 1:
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].

Example 2:
Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].

This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

Find Common Ancestor of given list of nodes in a Binary Tree

Q1: Maximum square area in a 2D array of elements 0s and 1s. It's a square iff when sub array(s) of N X N contains all 1s.

Q2: Make a MinStack class, with min operation (returns the minimum value of the stack) along with basic operations push, pop and top.

Q3: Find number of ways you can reach from the top of a 2-D array to the bottom right corner. You can go either right or down (one step) from current cell.

Q4: Same as Q3, but now you are given a 2-D array which can have guards in the cell (denoted as -1), then you cannot pass through that cell. Find number of ways to reach to the bottom right corner.

Q5: Count the number of connected components in a given graph. Build your own graph from given input:
N: number of vertices (starts with 1; if n = 5, there will be 5 vertices: 1,2,3,4,5)
Edges: Array of arrays. E.g. [[1,2], [2,7], ..]

Q6: Topological sorting of directed acyclic graph.

Finding the vertical sum in a binary tree
finding vertical sum of a 'n' ary tree

Q 1 .  F IN D   T H E   M O D E   O F   G IVE N   AR R AY
In statistics maths, a mode is a value that occurs the highest numbers of time.Given an array of integer (upto 100k elements), find the mode.
Solution Guidance:
    1.Time: O(n), Space O(n)
    2.Time: O(nlog n), Space O(1) -May destroy existing array.
    3.Time: O (n2), Space O(1)

Q2 .  H O P P IN G   T O   T H E   V I C T ORYGiven an array of non-negative integers, each number representing the maximum jump you can make from that spot. From spot i, you can to go any location from i to i+a[i]–Find the minimum number of jumps you need to make to go from a[0] to a[n-1].

Q 3 .  F IN D   L O N G E S T   P O S I T IVE   S U B-AR R AYGiven an array of integers, find the indices x and y to maximize y-x, such that i=x to y, and a(i) >= 0.
Example:
    Input: 1,-6,2,-1,4,-3
    Output: x=0, y=5, Sum = 0

Q1. FIND THE CLOSEST NUMBERWrite a function that accepts an integer, and returns a number that is closest number you can find in a binary search tree. Solution Guidance (where n is the number of nodes in the tree)
    1.Time: O(n)–Ok
    2.Time: O(log n)-Good

Q2. MIRROR MIRROR ON THEWALLWrite a function thataccepts a binary tree (may not be fully formed), and returns true if the Left Subtree is a mirror image of the Right Sub Tree. Solution Guidance:
    1.Time: O(n) –Traverse every element only once.

Q3. MAKE ME A MIRRORGiven a Binary Tree, assume fully formed, you are permitted to “exchange”the values of any two arbitrary nodes. Find the minimum number of “swaps”you need to make to transform thistree to a mirrored tree.
If any number of swaps will not transform this, return -1
